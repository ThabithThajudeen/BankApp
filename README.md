I built a bank app in .NET with the following functionalities: account management (create, delete, update, and retrieve bank accounts), transaction management, and user profile management (CRUD operations for user profiles). 
The app was integrated with an SQLite database, and APIs were created with appropriate endpoints. Was part of a 2 member team in building the project
